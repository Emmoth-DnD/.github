# Emmoth D&D

In this organisation you will find a framework that acts as a wrapper on top of the [FoundryVTT API](https://foundryvtt.com/api/)
as well as modules made for [FoundryVTT](https://github.com/foundryvtt) built upon this framework.

We're simply a group of people who play online DnD, and every now and then we find something we would like to change or
add to [FoundryVTT](https://github.com/foundryvtt), and so we create a custom module for it.

If you find any use of our modules for your own campaigns, feel free to clone and install them yourselves, same goes for
the framework :)

With time, a list of modules will be added to this README as well as some basic information
about the aforementioned framework.
